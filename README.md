# libmswmm
This projects aims at creating a library to read project files created by Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker for ME, XP and Vista (file extension .MSWMM, up to version 6.0). It explicitly does not try to support Windows *Live* Movie Maker (file extension .wlmp, version 14.0 onwards).

## Motivation
I have a lot of old project files and I guess many other people have too. I want to make it possible to view the contents of those projects so one can at least recreate them manually in a modern video editor or possibly even import them. It would also be interesting to generate an ffmpeg command from a project file.

For me, it is mostly a fun exercise in reverse engineering the file format and giving the Free Software world a capabilty that Microsoft can't offer.
